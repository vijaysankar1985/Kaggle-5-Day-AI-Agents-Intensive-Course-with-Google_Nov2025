Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`.

For thirty years, the lighthouse had been his world. Tonight, however, a faint shimmer beneath a loose floorboard caught his eye. Prying it open, he found a rolled parchment, brittle with age. As he unfurled it, an ethereal blue light pulsed from intricate markings that shifted and reformed. It wasn't ink, but some phosphorescent substance. The lines traced no known coast, no familiar sea lanes. Instead, they depicted a labyrinth of submerged caverns and celestial alignments, culminating in a single, radiant star marked \"X.\" Elias, a man of routine, felt a tremor of an unknown adventure stir within him.\nCriticAgent > The story is promising, but could benefit from a bit more depth. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1.  **Show, Don't Just Tell Elias's Routine and Personality:** While it's stated Elias is a man of routine and the lighthouse has been his world for thirty years, we don't *see* much of this routine or feel the weight of his isolation. Consider adding a brief scene or detail that illustrates his monotonous life before the discovery, making the \"tremor of an unknown adventure\" feel more impactful by contrast. For example, describe the ritual of his polishing, the specific sounds he hears that are now familiar, or a brief thought about the unchanging nature of his existence.\n\n2.  **Deepen the Mystery of the Map:** The description of the map is intriguing, but could be even more evocative. Instead of stating it's \"not ink, but some phosphorescent substance,\" describe *how* it glows. Does it flicker? Does it have a scent? Are the shifting markings subtle or dynamic? Similarly, the \"celestial alignments\" could be made more specific – are they constellations, planets, or something more abstract? This would enhance the sense of ancient, otherworldly knowledge.\n\n3.  **Foreshadow the \"Unknown Adventure\":** The story ends with Elias feeling a \"tremor of an unknown adventure.\" To make this more compelling, you could hint at what this adventure might entail or the immediate consequence of his discovery. Does the light from the map cast strange shadows? Does the roar of the waves seem to change? A subtle hint of what lies beyond the lighthouse could propel the reader forward, making them eager to know what Elias will do next.\nRefinerAgent > Elias meticulously polished the great Fresnel lens, the rhythmic sweep of his cloth a familiar ritual against the ceaseless roar of the waves. Thirty years he’d kept this solitary vigil, the lighthouse his unyielding world. Each night, the same: the lamp lit, the logbook filled, the lonely descent to his quarters. The salt-laced wind whistling through the tower’s stones was his only confidante, the crash of surf against the rocks his only music.\n\nBut tonight, the monotony fractured. A faint shimmer, aberrant and out of place, caught his eye beneath a loose floorboard near his cot. His gnarled fingers, accustomed to the predictable weight of tools and lamp oil, pried at the aged wood. It groaned in protest, revealing a hollow space. Inside, a rolled parchment, brittle and yellowed, lay waiting.\n\nAs Elias unfurled it, an ethereal blue light bloomed, pulsing with a soft, internal rhythm. It wasn't ink that formed the intricate markings, but some phosphorescent substance that seemed to writhe and reform as he watched, like captured starlight. The lines traced no known coast, no charted sea lanes. Instead, they depicted a labyrinth of submerged caverns, their passages winding like the intestines of some colossal sea beast. Strange celestial alignments, not of constellations he recognized but of alien planetary bodies, hung suspended above the treacherous geography. The map culminated in a single, radiant star, marked with a stark, definitive \"X.\"\n\nThe phosphorescence intensified, casting dancing blue shadows across Elias’s weathered face. The steady roar of the waves outside seemed to deepen, to take on a resonant, almost expectant tone. The parchment felt cool to the touch, yet it radiated a subtle energy that made the hairs on his arm stand on end. Elias, a man whose life had been defined by the unwavering beam of his lighthouse and the predictable turn of the tides, felt a tremor, profound and unfamiliar, stir within him. It was the tremor of an unknown adventure, whispering from the depths of the sea and the far reaches of the cosmos, promising a world far stranger than the one he had always known.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.
